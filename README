this is the mTest v0.5

I still can't get through the problem moving the TEST and pre-/pro-condition
of such TEST

This is really hard.

But I learn something new about Macro in C, which is dark and funny.

Bugs:
    1.how can it be outside the main itself but still can be controled
    2.how can each expect/case/suite get what it need from its parent
